## The Noise
We live in an age of infinite noise. Feeds, notifications, algorithmically generated infinite scrolls. It is easy to feel **isolated** even when we are more connected than ever. 

I have spent years as an IT Professional, building systems for others, solving problems, and keeping the lights on. But I recently realized that I was **hiding**.

> "To find yourself, think for yourself." - Socrates

## The Integrated Self
I am not just an IT guy. 
- I am an **Artist** who sees beauty in structure.
- I am a **Mentor** who wants to lift others up.
- I am a **Thinker** trying to make sense of the chaos.

This website is my attempt to integrate these identities. It is a "Digital Garden"—a place where ideas are planted, watered, and allowed to grow over time. Unlike a social media feed, which is ephemeral and disappears tomorrow, a garden is permanent.

## What to Expect
In this journal, I will be writing about:
1. **AI & Agents**: The technical revolution we are living through.
2. **Mental Models**: Tools for making better decisions.
3. **Finance**: Building freedom.
4. **Life**: The messy, beautiful human experience.

Thank you for visiting.
